## CSS Foundations
# What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?
# What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?
# How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
# Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
# What does the descendant combinator do?
# Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?
