# Fundamentals Part 4

## What is an array?
    Array is a list of elements that can be invoked by [element1, element2, element...]

## What are arrays useful for?
    To store multiples values to a variable;

## How do you access an array element?
    By its index in the array; given the array [element1, element2] [1] should access 'element2'

## How do you change an array element?
    Adding a new value to a indexed element; given the array [element1, element2] [1] = element3 should replace 'element2' to 'element3'

## What are some useful array properties?
    array.length gives the number of elements within the array;

## What are some useful array methods?
    array.push() adds a new element to the end of an array
    array.forEach() and array.map() does a callBackFn to every element within the array; 
    array.splice() removes and add a new element to an array by its given index;
    array.sort() sorts the array;

## What are loops useful for?
    To do continuos block of codes by a given condition

## What is the break statement?
    The break statement will break a loop and skip to the above code;
## What is the continue statement?
    The continue statement will skip to the next iteration of loop whenever it is called

## What is the advantage of writing automated tests?
    It prevents the code from possibles 'bugs' that could be fatal for a properly functional work
