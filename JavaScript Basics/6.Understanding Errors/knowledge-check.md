## What is the key difference between an error and a warning?
    Errors will stop the code from running, while warnings will prevent some possibles inner-functionality of the code.
## What is one method you can use to resolve an error?
    1 - Read the error and google it to understand its syntax;
    2 - Try debugging it trough dev tools source;
    3 - Use *console.log()* function as a debugger;
