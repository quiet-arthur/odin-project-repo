# Problem Solving 

## What are the three stages in the problem solving process?
    Planing on how to solve the problem by answering questions about the functionality of the solution; Pseudocoding it in natural language; Break the main problem into subproblem and resolve them, so the big problem can be solve; 
## Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?
    Cause you need to understand it so you can thing of a solution for it.
## What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?
    Write it down in a natural language so you can get a clear understand of it.
## What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?
    Break the main problem into sub problems and pseudocoding it.
## What is an algorithm?
    It's a a explanation of how a task should be done, step by step.
## What is pseudocode?
    It's implementing a resolution of a task/problem in a natural language.
## What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?
    Because solving smaller problems is usually easier than trying to solve directly the main problem.
