# Fundamentals Part 1 

## Name the three ways to declare a variable
    let <variable-name> = <its value>;
    var <variable-name> = <its value>;
    const <variable-name> = <its value>;
## Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
    The *var* declaration method. Because it is a old way to declare a variable in JavaScript.
## What rules should you follow when naming variables?
    Not using the first word capitalized and it can't have special characters, such as * , - = + 
## What happens when you add numbers and strings together?
    It will give you a concatenated string. 
## How does the Modulo (%), or Remainder, operator work?
    It will give the remainder of a division of two different numbers. Such as 8 % 3 is equal to 2. 
## Explain the difference between == and ===.
    == will compare the if the value of the variables are equal, while === will compare even the value and the 'typeof' from the variables.
## When would you receive a NaN result?
    When the return is not a Number type.
## How do you increment and decrement a number?
    By adding ++ to increment a variable or -- to decrement it.
## Explain the difference between prefixing and postfixing increment/decrement operators.
    Prefixing it will use the outcome value as the actual value of the variable. While postfixing it will only increment/decrement it. 
## What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
    Using ( ) wrapping what operation you wanna to give the most priority in the equation.
## How do you access developer tools and the console?
    Using right-click and pressing 'inspect' should open the console container. Or pressing ctrl + shift + c should do the same.
## How do you log information to the console?
    linking the .js file within the html file by the <script> tag.
## What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers? eg. +”10”
    It converts the the value to a typeof Number. *only when the value is not a Number typeof*.
